d) Write a program to count the number of 1â€™s in the contents of register D (which has value 75H), and store the count in register B.
MVI D, 75H     
MVI C, 08H 
MVI B, 00H    
MOV A, D 
ABC:RRC 
JNZ XYZ      
INR B          
XYZ: DCR C     
JNZ ABC        
MOV A, B       
STA 0100H      
HLT

OUTPUT:
Before Execution	After Execution
A=XX	                  A=05H
D=XX	                  D=75H
B=XX	                  B=05H
0100H=XX	          0100H=05H
