b) Calculate the sum of series of even numbers from the list of numbers.

The length of the list is in memory location 200H and the series itself

begins from memory location 201H. Assume the sum to be 8 bit number

so you can ignore carries and store the sum at memory location 300H

Code

LDA 0200H

MOV CA

MVI 8,00H

LXI H,0201H

Back: MOV A,M

ANI 01H

JNZ Skip

MOV A,M

ADD B

MOV BA

Skip: INX H

DCR C

JNZ Back

MOV A,B

STA 0300H

HLT

OUTPUT:
BEFORE EXECUTION

200H = 5H

201H = 7H

202H = 2H

203H = 3H

204H = 4H

205H = 5H

300H = XX
 AFTER EXECUTION

0200H=05H

0201H-07H

0202H-02H

0203H-03H

0204H-04H

0205H=05H

0300H=06H
