a. Pack the two unpacked BCD numbers stored in memory locations 400H and 401H and store result in memory location 402H. Assume the least significant digit is stored at 400H.
Code
LDA 0401H

MOV C,A
LDA 0400H
ADD C
STA 0402H

Output:
Before Execution:  After Execution:

0400H = 2           0400H = 2
0401H = 3           0401H = 3
0402H = XX          0402H = 32H
